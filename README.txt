This is a README file for CompareMyCode.

CompareMyCode is a web app written in Flask (Python)
for testing which version of code is easier to read.

Users will be presented with a short block of code,
and they will try to understand what it does.

When they figure out what it does, they press a button.
The time-to-understanding is recorded, and this can
be compared for different versions of code that does
the same thing.
